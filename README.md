# Phoenix Gym Admin System (Full-Stack Monorepo)

Welcome to the enterprise-level, production-ready **Phoenix Gym Admin System** monorepo! This repository contains both the high-fidelity responsive frontend dashboard and the secure JWT-protected Node.js Express REST API backend database service.

## 📂 Repository Layout
- **`frontend/`**: Single Page Application built using React.js (Vite), styled with Tailwind CSS, Lucide icons, Framer Motion, and dynamic Chart.js dashboards.
- **`backend/`**: REST API backend built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (Mongoose ODM). Includes secure JWT login gating, custom plans setup, invoicing tracking, reports compilation, and twilio/whatsapp notification servers.

### Automated membership-expiry emails

Production checks active memberships daily at 08:30 IST and emails clients exactly 3 days and 1 day before their end date. The sender defaults to `phoenixgym.vkp@gmail.com`. Set these Vercel environment variables before deploying:

```text
GMAIL_USER=phoenixgym.vkp@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-16-character-Google-app-password
CRON_SECRET=a-long-random-secret
GYM_NAME=Phoenix Fitness Centre
```

Enable two-step verification on the sender Gmail account, then create a Google App Password; do not use the normal Gmail password. The notification log prevents duplicate emails.
